# Hello World - Gotham Example Application

A Hello World example application for working with [Gotham](https://gotham.rs). 
Useful as a very light touch introduction to Gotham or as a point to build from
when you have very simple requirements and don't need a Router to handle 
dispatch, middleware, pipelines etc.

For an example of working with Gotham when you have more complex requirements
please see our official 
[example application](https://github.com/gotham-rs/example-app) which 
includes usage of the Gotham Router and other advanced Gotham components.
